# MongoDB Target Connector

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed guide on setting up the MongoDB target connector for the DataBrew project. The MongoDB connector allows for efficient and flexible storage of processed data, ensuring that your data pipeline's output is securely persisted in your MongoDB collections.

## Requirements

Before setting up the MongoDB target connector, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- Access to your MongoDB database.
- Necessary permissions to write data into the MongoDB collections.
- Understanding of the data schema and any constraints within your MongoDB database.

### Preparing Your MongoDB Database

To ensure smooth integration:

- **Permissions**: Verify that the DataBrew project's user account has write access to the desired collections.
- **Indexing**: Consider proper indexing on your collections to optimize query performance for future read operations.

## Cloud Setup

This section guides you through setting up the MongoDB target connector in the cloud for the DataBrew project.

### Setting up in Cloud

1. **Access DataBrew Cloud Platform**: Navigate to [DataBrew Cloud App](https://app.databrew.tech).
2. **Create a New Target Connector Instance**: Follow these steps...
    - Step 1: Choose 'MongoDB' from the list of available target connectors.
    - Step 2: Provide the necessary connection details, including your MongoDB host, database name, and credentials.
    - Step 3: Configure the connector by specifying the target collections and any necessary document mappings or transformations.
    - (Include screenshots or code snippets if necessary)

## Open Source Setup
Blink configuration for Target MongoDB connector should look as follows:

```yaml
sink:
  driver: mongodb
  config:
    uri: ${DATABASE_URI}
    database: ${DATABASE_NAME}
    stream_prefix: 'example_' # Specify if you need your streams to have collections with prefixes in target db
```

## Important Section

In this section, we include essential tips, tricks, and important information related to the MongoDB target connector for the DataBrew project.

- **Data Consistency**: Ensure that the data written to your MongoDB collections maintains consistency with the expected schema or data model.
- **Document Size Limits**: Be mindful of MongoDB's document size limits and structure your data accordingly.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage any issues during the data write process, such as network failures or schema mismatches.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilize MongoDB's performance optimization features, such as write concerns, indexing, and sharding, to ensure efficient data storage operations.

## Conclusion

In this document, we covered the requirements, cloud setup, and important notes for setting up the MongoDB target connector for the DataBrew project. By following the steps outlined, you can ensure that your processed data is efficiently and reliably stored in your MongoDB database.
