# WebSocket Target Connector for DataBrew

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed guide on setting up the WebSocket target connector for the DataBrew project. The WebSocket connector allows for real-time streaming of processed data, ensuring that your data pipeline's output is seamlessly integrated and instantly available to WebSocket clients.

## Requirements

Before setting up the WebSocket target connector, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- Access to a WebSocket server or service where data will be streamed.
- Necessary permissions and access controls to send data through the WebSocket connection.
- Understanding of WebSocket protocols and data formatting requirements.

### Preparing Your WebSocket Environment

To ensure smooth integration:

- **WebSocket Server Configuration**: Ensure that your WebSocket server is properly configured to accept connections and handle incoming data streams.
- **Client Access Control**: Verify that clients intended to receive the data have the necessary access and are properly authenticated, if required.

## Cloud Setup

This section guides you through setting up the WebSocket target connector in the cloud for the DataBrew project.

### Setting up in Cloud

1. **Access DataBrew Cloud Platform**: Navigate to [DataBrew Cloud App](https://app.databrew.tech).
2. **Create a New Target Connector Instance**: Follow these steps...
    - Step 1: Choose 'WebSocket' from the list of available target connectors.
    - Step 2: Provide the necessary connection details, including the WebSocket server URL and any required headers or authentication details.
    - Step 3: Configure the message formatting and streaming settings as required.
    - (Include screenshots or code snippets if necessary)

## Open Source Setup

Make sure you have `Blink` installed or Docker image pulled.
If not - go to [Installation section](Installation.md)

### Specify destinations
Blink configuration should look as follows:

```yaml
sink:
  driver: websocket
  config:
    url: ${WEBSOCKET_URL} # wss://gateway.yourp.com
    headers: 
      - header_key: value
      - header_key_2: value
```

## Important Section

In this section, we include essential tips, tricks, and important information related to the WebSocket target connector for the DataBrew project.

- **Data Format Consistency**: Ensure that the data format used for WebSocket messages is consistent and aligns with the client's expectations for parsing and processing the data.
- **Connection Management**: Implement robust connection handling to manage WebSocket connections, handle reconnections, and ensure data is not lost during any network interruptions.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Monitor the performance of your WebSocket server, especially if handling large volumes of data or a high number of concurrent connections. Consider scalability solutions if necessary.

## Conclusion

In this document, we covered the requirements, cloud setup, and important notes for setting up the WebSocket target connector for the DataBrew project. By following the steps outlined, you can ensure that your processed data is efficiently and reliably streamed to clients via WebSocket connections.
