# Create Destination Data Connector

Target Data Connectors are not that different from the Source ones.
They are basically the same, except you don't have to define a data you will stream to these connectors.

## Create a new Target Data Connector

Open a cloud DataBrew dashboard [Here](https://app.databrew.tech/connectors)
At the beginning it will have no connectors create but, we can create a new one by pressing `New Connector` button

This will open a connector creation interface, and you will see all the supported connector types we can start with.

Here you have to select `Target` at the top to list all the supported Target Data Connectors. 

> Please note. Source and Target Data Connector pairs are not generally equal. That means some of the Data Connectors can 
> only be used to consume data from them, while the others may be capable of consuming and producing data
