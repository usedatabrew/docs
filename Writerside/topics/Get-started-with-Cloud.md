# Get started with Cloud

In this section we will explain how to start building your event driven architecture with DataBrew

We will shortly cover the next parts:

- How to create a new Data Source Connector
- How to create a new Data Destination Connector
- How to add processors the in between the connectors
- And to how monitor your pipeline

## Before we start

Before we start, you have to create an account in DataBrew Cloud.
Go to the [https://databrew.tech](https://databrew.tech) and create a new one. Don't worry, it's completely free and more than enough to
get things up and running.


Make sure that:
- Your account is created and verified
- You have a data source you want to start with (it can be PostgreSQL, MongoDB instance, any Data Connector that DataBrew supports)
