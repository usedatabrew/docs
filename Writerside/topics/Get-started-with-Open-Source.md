# Get started with Open Source

In DataBrew, we understand the importance of having robust and reliable data pipelines cloud, but we also understand the need
when you don't want tot go with cloud just yet. Or you can't be a vendor locked at some technology.

That's why we decided to Open Source our internal streaming solution. 
It's being shipped with MIT licence, meaning you are pretty much allowed to do anything you want with that code, but we 
ask you to be respectful.

## Meet Blink
Blink is an Open Source project aimed to help developers to build data pipelines with ease using their own deployments.
