# Security in DataBrew

At DataBrew, we prioritize the security and confidentiality of your data. Our framework is designed with robust security measures to ensure that your data remains protected at all times. Here are the core aspects of our security approach:

### Data Pipeline Isolation

- **Organizational Linking:** Each data pipeline in DataBrew is uniquely linked to its respective organization. This linkage ensures strict data segregation, meaning the data flow within a pipeline is isolated and cannot be accessed or interfered with by any other entity. This isolation is fundamental in maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized access or data leakage between different organizational pipelines.

- **Pipeline Integrity:** We employ advanced security protocols to ensure that the integrity of each data pipeline is maintained. From the point of data ingestion to processing and output, every stage is secured and monitored to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. This holistic security approach guarantees that your data is handled responsibly and securely within the confines of your designated pipeline.

### Secure Credential Storage

- **Third-Party Secret Management:** For the storage of database credentials and other sensitive information, DataBrew integrates with a specialized third-party secret management solution, [Doppler.com](https://doppler.com). This partnership ensures that your credentials are stored securely, using industry-standard encryption methods.

- **Encryption and Access Control:** All sensitive data, including database credentials, is encrypted and safeguarded within Doppler's secure environment. Access to this data is strictly controlled and monitored, ensuring that only authorized personnel can retrieve or interact with these credentials. This level of security prevents exposure or unauthorized use of your sensitive data.

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Our integration with Doppler.com includes continuous monitoring and auditing capabilities. This ensures that any access to sensitive information is logged and scrutinized, providing an additional layer of security and accountability.

### Commitment to Security
